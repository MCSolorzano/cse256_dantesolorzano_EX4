Hello! This is my submission for the EX 4 assignment for CIS 256.

To play the game, cd into the repository directory and run in a terminal:

```
py guess_the_word.py
```

To run tests on the game, have `pytest` installed in your machine and run the following command while in the directory:

```
python -m pytest
```

That should be it! Thanks!
